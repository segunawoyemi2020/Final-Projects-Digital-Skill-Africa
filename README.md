# PROJECT 2
## Topic: Palmoria Group HR Analytics – Gender Equality Case Study
## Project Background
An HR analytics case study for Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company facing challenges with:
* Gender inequality
* Pay gaps
* Salary compliance across regions and departments
This project delivers insights and recommendations to promote fairness and inclusion.

## Objectives

*	Examine performance ratings by gender
*	Identify potential gender pay gaps
*	Assess compliance with the $90,000 minimum wage regulation
*	Allocate bonuses based on departmental performance
*	Provide visual insights and strategic HR recommendations

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Performed using Power Query in Power BI:
- Removed duplicates and invalid records (e.g., missing salary or department)
- Assigned "N/A" to employees with no gender information

- Merged the employee dataset with bonus rules on Department and Rating

  ## Tools Used
  Power BI for:
  * Data modeling
  * DAX measures
  * Interactive dashboards
  * Visualizations

## Key Insights
* The organization’s total salary expenditure is ₦71.92 million for 946 employees, with annual bonuses totaling ₦2.2 million (approximately 3% of total pay).
* Kaduna accounts for the highest share of bonus payments and overall compensation, suggesting regional disparities in cost allocation.
* Gender distribution is broadly balanced (~49% male, ~47% female), but males earn approximately 3.5% more on average despite females achieving higher average performance ratings.
* The compliance rate stands at a low 30.87%, highlighting significant policy adherence challenges.

## Recommendations
*  Conduct gender pay audit to address observed gap.
*   Investigate and improve low compliance rate via training and policy updates
*   Review regional salary allocations to align with role needs and budget
*   Extend analysis to turnover rates, department-level trends, and time-based patterns
